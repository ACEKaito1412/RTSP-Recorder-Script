# EZVIZ RTSP Recorder (Dynamic IP Support)

This script continuously records an RTSP stream from a compatible IP camera in 15-minute segments, even if the camera's IP address changes within a known subnet. It was designed to make use of an old laptop as a lightweight, always-on recorder‚Äîno need for bulky or resource-heavy software.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Automatically **scans a subnet** to find the camera if its IP changes  
- Records in **15-minute chunks**, aligned with the hour  
- Uses `ffmpeg` for efficient video encoding  
- Creates output in `$HOME/cctv_recordings`  
- Auto-retries when the camera is temporarily offline  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- Linux system (tested on Ubuntu)  
- [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed  
- `nc` (Netcat) installed  

Install both with:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg netcat
```

## üîß Configuration (in ezviz_recorder.sh)

```bash
SUBNET="192.168.1"           # Subnet to scan
START=2                      # Starting host address
END=20                       # Ending host address
PORT=554                     # RTSP port (default for EZVIZ)
USERNAME="admin"             # Camera username
PASSWORD=""                  # Camera password
CHANNEL_PATH="/Streaming/Channels/102"  # Substream path (e.g. /101 or /102)
RECORD_DURATION=900          # 15 minutes = 900 seconds
OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/cctv_recordings"     # Where files will be saved
```

## üèÉ Usage
Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x ezviz_recorder.sh
./ezviz_recorder.sh
```

It will:

- Scan the IP range 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.20

- Connect to the first reachable RTSP stream

- Start recording in 15-minute segments

- Loop continuously, aligning to the top of the hour

## üìÅ Output Format
Files will be saved as:

```bash
192_168_1_10_2025-06-08 03:00:00_part_1.mp4
192_168_1_10_2025-06-08 03:00:00_part_2.mp4
...
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This script assumes only one camera will be active at a time within the given subnet.

- The script loops infinitely and should be run as a background process or service.
